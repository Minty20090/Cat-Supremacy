                <p>Hello! I'm a high schooler in sunny Los Angeles who's planning on majoring in computer science.
                    In my free time, I love reading science fiction novels or working on one of my ceramics projects.
                    A fun fact about me is that I can never pass up a good passion fruit macaron. In fact, I will fight
                    you for the right to consume a passion fruit macaron.

                <h1>Mimi</h1>
                <p>This is Mimi! We rescued her from a steel workshop almost 12 years ago. A few workers were
                    feeding Mimi and her newborn litter. We don't know how old she is but we know she's the oldest of our cats.
                     She's now living her best life with lots of cuddles and all the food she can eat.

                <h1>Raisin</h1>
                <p>This is Raisin! She's Mimi's daughter, whom we rescued along with her mother.
                    Five-year-old me chose to name her Raisin since she looks sort of like a Raisin!
                    She's probably the clingiest cat in our family. She loves taking naps with us.
                    She will not let you sleep unless she's in the same bed as you.

                <h1>Oreo</h1>
                <p>This is Oreo! She's also Mimi's daughter. She looks sort of like an oreo because of
                    the white ring of fur around her neck. She's the loudest of all of our cats. She has
                    an unhealthy habit of going up to your ear and meowing as loud as she can.

                <h1>Boba</h1>
                <p>This is Boba! He's our newest cat. We rescued him two years ago after he 
                    got injured in cat fight. He's the cuddliest of the cats. He's the only one
                    that'll climb onto your lap. Unfortunately, he's also the heaviest. This means 
                    that in summer, it's like being smothered by a giant mass of fur.
